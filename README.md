# terraform-provider-nix

A terraform provider for [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) builds and [nixos](https://nixos.org/) installations.

With this provider you can do things like:

- Build a vm image from a nix expression and deploy it with terraform.
- Build a docker image from a nix expression and deploy it with terraform.
- Manage a nixos installation via ssh.

Note, this is a completely different project from [the existing plugin in nixpkgs](https://github.com/tweag/terraform-provider-nixos).
Please consult that project to decide which suites your needs better.

## Quickstart

This will run the example which is a good starting point, demonstrating all options. The example
uses google cloud, though I would appreciate contributed examples for other platforms. After running
the example you will have a managed server and vm images.

```
go build
cd example
terraform init -plugin-dir ../
terraform apply -var google_cloud_project=your_project_id
```

## Debugging

To view commands being run, set the env variable TF_LOG=debug.

## Example configuration and options

See the example directory for an example configuration with all valid options specified.

## Development Status

Working, but want feedback and users. Currently breaking changes are possible to enhance the 
design. Breaking changes will be announced on the mailing list.
